	abstract = {Supervised machine learning is the classification of new data based on already classified training examples. In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases where classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speedup is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a nonsparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.},

	abstract = {Machine-learning tasks frequently involve problems of manipulating and classifying large numbers of vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space. Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding. Quantum machine learning can take time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms.},

This is important for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing applications in the {IT} industry. In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, we propose a new machine-learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a quantum Hamiltonian. Because of the noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the quantum Boltzmann machine ({QBM}) can become nontrivial. We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the {QBM} efficiently by sampling. We show examples of {QBM} training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors for {QBM} training and application.},

	abstract = {We propose a Quantum-Inspired Subspace({QIS}) Ensemble Method for generating feature ensembles based on feature selections. We assign each principal component a Fraction Transition Probability as its probability weight based on Principal Component Analysis and quantum interpretations. In order to generate the feature subset for each base regressor, we select a feature subset from principal components based on Fraction Transition Probabilities. The idea originating from quantum mechanics can encourage ensemble diversity and the accuracy simultaneously. We incorporate Quantum-Inspired Subspace Method into Random Forest and propose Quantum-Inspired Forest. We theoretically prove that the quantum interpretation corresponds to the first order approximation of ensemble regression. We also evaluate the empirical performance of Quantum-Inspired Forest and Random Forest in multiple hyperparameter settings. Quantum-Inspired Forest proves the significant robustness of the default hyperparameters on most data sets. The contribution of this work is two-fold, a novel ensemble regression algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and the theoretical connection between quantum interpretations and machine learning algorithms.},
